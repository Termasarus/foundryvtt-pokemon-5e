you level, you gain access the following class features</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Starter Pokemon</h2>\n<p>A trainer must begin with any single unevolved Pokemon of Species Rating (SR) 1/2 or lower with the base stats in its stat block. This Pokemon starts with a nature of the player's choice. See the Pokemon Nature section in Pokemon Care for available natures. A Pokemon by SR list is at the end of this manual as well.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Trainer Specialization</h2>\n<p>Every pokemon has their own unqie traits and specilites and as you grow as a trainer you learn to better understand, utilize, and take care of them. At levels 2, 7, and 15 select a type Specialization pokemon.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Trainer Path</h2>\n<p>As pokemon trainers gain experiance they begin to define their style of training, at level 3 choose a training style to define your path to mastery and at levels 5, 9, and 15 gain the associated abilties.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Pokemon Control Upgrade</h2>\n<p>Each species of Pokemon is given its own Species Rating (SR). More on Species Rating can be found on page 13. The stronger the Pokemon, the more difficult they are to control. The type of Pokemon you can control in the game depends on the level of your character (As seen in the Trainer Level Table above). Without the proper level, a Pokemon with a higher SR than allowed will refuse to obey you. The maximum Pokemon SR that you can control increases at levels 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, and 17.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Rapid Switching</h2>\n<p>By the time you reach 10th level, you have had your fair share of difficult battles and have grown in skill and experiance. As a bonus action <span style=\"color:#191813;font-size:13px;font-family:var(--font-primary)\">you can recall and release Pokemon during combat as a bonus action.<br /></span></p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">On My Command</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color:#191813;font-size:13px\">Your experiance and trust you have earned is felt by all your Pokemon. When you reach level 13, you may use a bonus action to speak a commanding phrase. Until the end of your next turn, your Pokemon within 60 feet of you have advantage on their attacks. You may use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier. This pool resets at each long rest.<br /></span></p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Master Trainer</h2>\n<p>At level 20, your Pokemon are at peak fighting performance. When you or your Pokemon fail a saving throw, you may choose to succeed instead. This feature can be used twice per long rest.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"pokemon-trainer","levels":1,"hitDice":"d12","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"e6qgfaz07fgy8p1f","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{}},{"_id":"7bnm3vmp2upc67ru","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.world.homebrew-pokemon-class-and-features.FMU65mmzCe9icAYj"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"rvuht1m3j1zotts6","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.world.homebrew-pokemon-class-and-features.3GbG7WYxT3wQ3nYm"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":13,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"c5qoy0s21zwukemd","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.world.homebrew-pokemon-class-and-features.uzcKIqd1N7RnAeNn"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"dy3dpja7o2i30caw","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.pokemon-5e.classes.lzq1GA56UhMLPu89"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"alz4wl63xrizqwmv","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.world.homebrew-pokemon-class-and-features.7rQRQ9kWqJVEzwRd"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["str","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["acr","ani","ath","dec","his","ins","itm","inv","med","nat","prc","prf","per","rel","slt","ste","sur","arc"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"XAs41eFDCbTi2BN5":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.kubDljW7IMnQw4hg"}},"_id":"fYxqdHfIMaPWoWCw"}
